# Features Directory

The `@features/` directory contains feature-based modules that organize the application's functionality into logical, self-contained units. Each feature encapsulates related components, hooks, services, and types to promote maintainability and separation of concerns.

## Directory Structure

```
src/features/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ admin/           # Database administration interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ episode/         # Episode display and management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ podcast/         # Podcast display and trending data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ search/          # Search functionality and results
```

## Design Principles

### Feature-Based Architecture
Each feature is self-contained with its own:
- **Components**: UI elements specific to the feature
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for state management and data fetching
- **Services**: API calls and external service integrations (where applicable)
- **Types**: TypeScript type definitions (where applicable)
- **Index files**: Clean public API exports

### Separation of Concerns
- Features are independent and can be developed/maintained separately
- Clear boundaries between different application domains
- Minimal coupling between features
- Shared utilities and components in separate directories

### Reusability
- Components are designed to be reusable across the application
- Hooks provide clean abstractions for common functionality
- Services can be easily mocked for testing

### Type Safety
- Comprehensive TypeScript types for all features
- Type-safe API responses and component props
- Proper error handling with typed error states

## Best Practices

1. **Import Organization**: Use feature-based imports from the main index files
2. **State Management**: Use React Query for server state and local state for UI
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error boundaries and error states
4. **Loading States**: Provide skeleton loaders and loading indicators
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all components work across different screen sizes
6. **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG guidelines for inclusive design

## Adding New Features

To add a new feature:

1. Create a new directory in `src/features/`
2. Follow the established structure (components, hooks, services, types)
3. Create an `index.ts` file with public exports
4. Update this README with feature documentation
5. Ensure proper TypeScript types and error handling

## Dependencies

Features may depend on:
- `@/components/ui/` - Shared UI components
- `@/hooks/` - Shared utility hooks
- `@/lib/` - Utility functions and configurations
- `@/types/` - Global type definitions
